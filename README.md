> Today, with the increase in competition between companies and the development of technology, companies need to improve themselves continuously. In this case, customer demands are very important. Customer demands must be supplied a minimum cost and time. To supply with these customer demands at minimum cost and time, the vehicle routing problem is used. In this study, the demands are conveyed to the related demand places by using different types of vehicles coming out from more than one storage place. In this study, it is aimed to carry the demands at minimum cost. For the problem, a capacity-constrained multi-depot mathematical model was created. GAMS and heuristic solution methods are aimed to solve the mathematical model. In heuristic, the nearest neighbor algorithm is used for the first solution, and the tabu search algorithm is used for the optimum solution.As a result of the web, after entering the warehouse and demand information, Finally, the website was created. The route visualization and total cost can be seen on the map.
